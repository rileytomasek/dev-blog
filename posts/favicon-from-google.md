This URL can be used to get a favicon for any domain from Google:  
https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=rile.yt

It redirects to a URL like this that allows you to change attributes like the size:  
https://t1.gstatic.com/faviconV2?client=SOCIAL&type=FAVICON&fallback_opts=TYPE,SIZE,URL&url=http://google.com&size=16

The `t1` subdomain can be different values, but changing it doesn't seem to break the link so it may be possible to use the resolved URL directly.
